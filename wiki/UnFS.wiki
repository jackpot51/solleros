===Introduction===
UnFS is a node based filesystem that uses variable size pointers to memory locations and disk blocks to manage files.

===Header Structure===
The header contains information about the filesystem that is extremely important.
|| *Size* || *Default* || *Meaning* ||
|| 1 || 4 || This is the length of the filesystem's signature ||
|| 4 || "UnFS" || This is the signature of the filesystem ||
|| 2 || 1 || This is the version of the filesystem ||
|| 1 || 6 || This is the size of the block pointers in bytes ||
|| 1 || 4 || This is the size of the memory pointers in bytes ||
|| 1 || 2 || This is the size of user and group ID's in bytes ||
|| 1 || 9 || This is the size of the allocation cluster in bytes as an exponent of 2 ||
|| 1 || 0 || This is the character encoding used by the filesystem ||
|| 4 || N/A || This is a pointer to the root node collection's sector list ||
|| 4 || N/A || This is a pointer to the index's sector list ||

===Node Collection Structure===
A node collection holds the nodes of the children of a certain node.
|| *Size* || *Meaning* ||
|| 4 || Location of the end of the node collection as an offset from the root node collection. ||
|| N/A || Various nodes. See below. ||
|| 4 || 0 if this is the last portion of the node collection and an offset from the root node collection pointing to the next portion if it is not. ||

===Node Structure===
A node holds information about files and folders. It points to the sector list, index information, security information, its parent's node, and has a type that denotes wether it is a file, folder, link, device, etc.
|| *Size* || *Meaning* ||
|| 4 || Location of the index entry as an offset in the index ||
|| 1 || Type. 0 is a folder, 1 is a file, more will be added ||
|| 4 || Location of the security information. 0 gives everyone full access.||
|| 4 || Location of the node collection as an offset from the root node collection for folders or sector list for files. ||
|| 4 || Location of parent node as an offset from root node collection. 0 means no parent. ||

===Sector List Structure===
The sector list holds block numbers pointing to a file's actual data.
|| *Size* || *Meaning* ||
|| 4 || The offset of the end of the list in the root node collection ||
|| 6 || The LBA of the first sector in a fragment. ||
|| 6 || The LBA of the last sector in a fragment. ||
|| N/A || There can be more paired LBAs here. ||
|| 4 || 0 if this is the last fragment. It points to the next fragment if it is not.||

===Index Structure===
The index will hold useful and searchable metadata pertaining to the file such as modification and creation times and the file name.
|| *Size* || *Meaning* ||
|| 4 || This is a pointer back to the file's or folder's node as an offset in the root node collection. ||
|| N/A || This is the name of the file or folder as a zero terminated string. ||

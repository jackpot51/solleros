#summary Hopefully this will help people start using/abusing/getting abused by SollerOS

===In order to test SollerOS:===

====If you are using Windows(preferably Windows XP or above):====
  # Unzip the newest archive from the Downloads section
  # Double click on testhd.bat

====If you are using Linux, BSD, Solaris, or some other good UNIX-based OS:====
  # Unzip the newest archive from the Downloads section
  # Install qemu and nasm with apt-get, yum, deb, pkg-add, or whatever package manager you have`*`
  # Open a terminal
  # Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the archive
  # Run "./testhd.sh" or "sh testhd.sh"

 `*`For Mac OS X you should go to macports.org and download and install macports which will let you download qemu and nasm. [http://svn.macports.org/repository/macports/downloads/MacPorts-1.7.1/MacPorts-1.7.1-10.5-Leopard.dmg Here is the newest version for Leopard.] You may also need GCC-check online for ways to obtain that.

===In order to develop apps/test the filesystem of SollerOS===
You will need to install the latest JDK(Java Development Kit) and look at my programming
manual for information about the interrupts used to interface with SollerOS. You can also
look at the example programs and example batch scripts I have which should provide some
help for anyone who wants to test their programs on SollerOS.

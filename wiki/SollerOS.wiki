SollerOS is a mediocre operating system designed to have a very low overhead and to run on almost any x86 system. Its features include:
  * Batches/editor
  * Documents/editor
  * Math
  * Variables
  * 3rd party apps(see etch-a-sketch and mouse)
  * VGA mode
  * Loops and if-else commands
  * Protected Mode
  * And more

Future Features/Improvements may include
  * Better variables(current variable system causes horrible fragmentation of memory)
  * Multitasking in protected mode
  * Graphics
  * Sound
  * Games
  * And more

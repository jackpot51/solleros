Congratulations, you found this file in SollerOS and used the showtxt
command to view it. The disk command will list the contents of the disk.
The showbmp and showtxt commands will show you bmp and txt files,
respectively. Any file that is put into the 'included' folder will
be included in the image file when SollerOS is built. However, only
raw text files and 16 bit bmp files can currently be read.

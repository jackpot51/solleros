Congratulations, you found this file in SollerOS and used the show command
to view it. The ls command will list the contents of the disk. The show
commands will show you bmp and txt files. Any file that is put into the
'included' folder will be included in the image file when SollerOS is built.
However, only raw text files and 16 bit bmp files can currently be read.
